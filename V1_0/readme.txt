'Fixes' the behaviour of the main board read/unread icons.

This mod will cause the main board icons reflect whether there are unread/new topics within the board.
For performance reasons, SMF uses a "lightweight" approach that is enough for most setups. If you're not happy with that, then you should try this ;)

Note: Upon installation of the mod any unread main board icons will remain unread until a formerly read topic becomes unread.
